where every activity concerning car and bike rental business is limited to a physical location only.
Even though the physical location has not been totally eradicated;
the nature of functions and how these functions are achieved has been reshaped by the power of the internet.

to efficiently and effectively manage the business and satisfy customers’ needs at the click of a button.
